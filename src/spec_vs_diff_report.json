  "summary": "Diff implements global typography (Quicksand/Pacifico) with font preloading to avoid flash, defines birthday theme CSS variables, introduces a PrimaryCtaButton wrapper to ensure CTA visibility, and restores/implements royal gold framed photo styling via global .royal-frame styles and use of FramedPhoto on MessageScreen2. Some additional visual/behavioral enhancements appear beyond the requested scope (e.g., extra decorative effects and content/animation changes on non-target areas).",
